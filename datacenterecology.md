# Data center ecology

New construction of office space and data center square footage is converging, and data centers are likely to be more prevalent in the future. 

Given the LLM race happening in the mid-2020s, tech companies are seriously cutting corners when it comes to data center delivery in the name of rapid scale up. This has resulted in the development of large-scale projects in low value land far from cities that can tap directly into natural gas lines for the enormous energy needs.

â–· **Build data centers physically within a industrial ecosystem and establish infrastructure to use the waste heat for useful work, including space heating, food production, and industrial processes.**

Looking forward, there are better models for how data centers can be incorporated into the rest of the built environment to reduce overall resource consumption. Two of those strategies are industrial ecology and renewable energy use. The topic of solar PV integration into data centers has been covered elsewhere, so I'll focus on industrial ecology.
