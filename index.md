# Now City

A community focused on **long-term urbanism** with a mixture of speculative design and a concern for future generations.

## Topics
- SLR max: Urban design for the maximum extent of sea level rise
- Organized migration: Moving billions of people away from extreme heat at the equator to newly arable land
- Entropy max: A framework for thinking about long-term investments
- FAR 3.0: A pattern language for resource efficient walkable urbanism
- Robo districts: What is a robot district and how can it make human districts even better
- Permacity: Permaculture ethos applies to urbanism
- Post placebased solutions: What happens to cities when place is replaced by movement

## About

Now City is a line of inquiry, inclusive of the following topics. How can a “smart city” both take full advantage of both computing and sensing technology without losing the warranted trust of its citizens? How can a city be ecologically sustainable while also being global? How can a city be wealthy without also disenfranchising those who do not share that wealth? How can a city be self-determined by its citizens while also accepting guidance from earned wisdom?

The problems being posed to representative democratic institutions are complex, and historical evidence would suggest that our current institutions lack the capacity to solve issues like climate change and social inequality. We believe that the codes that govern cities could be improved to enable mutualism through innovative mechanism design, especially in the realms of decision-making and ownership. We are inspired by Jane Jacobs’ Cities and the Wealth of Nations, Nils Gilman’s The Mutualist Economy: A New Deal for Ownership, Benjamin Bratton’s The Stack, and Constant Nieuwenhuys’ New Babylon.

## Long-term urbanism

City management models today must plan for climate instability. By this, we mean the incompatibility of existing cities with future climate conditions, the understanding of city identity as geographically fixed, and, ultimately, mass climate migrations. Research on the projected geographical shift of the human temperature niche shows that for each 1 degree Celsius of global warming, 1 billion people would be in unsuitably warm areas, which means entire cities will need to migrate. On the positive side, more total land area will be available for human habitation than before, especially in the global north. Unfortunately, Westphalian nation-states have demonstrated an unwillingness to accept mass uncontrolled immigration. Optimistically, Now Cities could be created within migration destination countries to realize the economic potential arising from the influx of additional demand and labor, especially as organic reproduction dwindles, while also sidestepping xenophobia triggers from within the existing population. These Now City franchises could not only save millions of lives by opening routes for organized migration, but also be an avenue for a new approach to sharing wealth and resources.
