# Post place-based solutions

Place can be surprisingly impermanent. Railroad towns, factory towns, canal towns, other things that have gone by the wayside as the economy changes. As climate shifts, places may change, too. Of course there is value in the frame of place as a high priority, so this line of inquiry simply brings up some shortcomings of using place as the only framing for solutions and offers alternative framings.

## Some alternative framings

Temporary-based solutions
