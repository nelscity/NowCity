# SLR max

## Why 70 meters is the max
Long-term investment in cities should be located at least [70m (~230')](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-would-sea-level-change-if-all-glaciers-melted) above GMSL 1993 (1-2m variance from NAVD88 for us North Americans) because the there is enough heat in the ocean already from Global Warming to melt the surface ice.

When scientists talk about “if all the surface ice melted,” they generally mean that every bit of land‐based ice—including the vast Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets as well as all smaller glaciers and ice caps—were to melt completely. Under this scenario, the global mean sea level is estimated to rise by roughly 70 meters (about 230 feet) relative to today’s sea level. Under current estimates based on the mass of the ice sheets and glaciers: the **Antarctic ice sheet** contributes roughly **58 m**, the **Greenland ice sheet** adds about **7 m**, and all **other glacier ice** contributes an additional **~0.4–0.6 m**. Together, these components store over 99% of the Earth's freshwater ice and add up to approximately 70 meters of global sea level rise. 

This is actually good news, because 500 million years ago the sea level was about [180-225 meters](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2013083118) above current levels, but that was due to reduced ocean basin volume due to rapid seafloor spreading.

## When to plan for the max
The following is the sea level rise high-end ("worst-case") scenario for long-term planning.
- **Year 2000:** **0 meters** (roughly baseline, actually GMSL 1993)
- **Year 2100:** **~2.0 meters** (Based on IPCC AR6 low-likelihood, high-impact storylines for very high emissions scenarios (SSP5-8.5), representing potential rapid ice sheet contributions, particularly from Antarctica. Sources like the 2022 U.S. Interagency Sea Level Rise Technical Report cite this figure based on IPCC AR6.)
- **Year 2500:** **~12 meters** (Fastest plausible scenario: near-complete melt of Glaciers/Ice Caps, Greenland, and West Antarctica within ~500 years.)
- **Year 3500:** **~22 meters** (Contribution from vulnerable East Antarctic marine basins over the subsequent ~1000 years.)
- **Year 7000:** **~70 meters** (Minimum timeframe for potential _complete_ land ice melt, including the slow-melting core of East Antarctica.)

Year 7000 feels like a long ways away, but it is within what the Long Now Foundations considers "now", which is the next 10,000 years.
## SLR and infrastructure
Or, how long is your ambition?

[Pons Fabricius (Rome)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pons_Fabricius) was completed in 62 BC, this bridge remains in use today. [Hagia Sophia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia) was completed in 537 AD. If these landmarks were built today to last 2,000 years, they should be 47 meters or 155 feet above sea level in the worst-case scenario. If you're wondering how much longer they can last, Pons Fabricus is 6.0 m (19.8 feet) above sea level and Hagia Sophia is 47.8 m (156.7 feet) above sea level.

Not everything is a timeless monument. Planting crops near sea level is fine. Making improvements to homes near sea level is fine. But, when considering infrastructure with longer lifespans, it is worth building at higher elevations. 

Here are some examples made with [this calculator](/SLRcalc):
- **Residential buildings and roads**: 50 years - 0.60 meters (2 feet). Note, this is similar to the typical "design flood elevation" that is 2 feet above FEMA's base flood elevation (BFE)
- **Commercial buildings:** 100 years - 1.60 meters (5.25 feet)
- **Suspension Bridges:** 150 years - 2.80 meters (9.19 feet)  
- **Concrete Dams:** 200 years - 4.00 meters (13.12 feet)

Most flood risk right now thinks about the "1-in-500 year storm" (or, 0.2% chance storm). While it is important to consider those individual events that will cause flooding, I think it also useful to consider the impact of SLR in relation to the expected lifespan of the infastructure. 

## Some long-term suggestions for Massachusetts in particular
- Build I-495 corridor, which is 70m above NAVD88
- Move State House to Worcester
